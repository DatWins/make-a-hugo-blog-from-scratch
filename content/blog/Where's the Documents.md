**Situation** Employee was given documents to sign. Supervisor and 204B step away for a moment to handle urgent request. 204B came back to employee's location. He noticed the file folder is still on the counter. He took the file folder and gave it back to Supervisor. Supervisor looked inside the file folder and didn't see the paperworks. 204B told supervisor that was the only thing on the counter.

**Task** Supervisor spoke to employee and he said he signed the documents and left on the counter. Both Supervisor and 204B looked everywhere for the documents but couldn't find any. 
Meanwhile, employee left on a break.

**Action** Both Supe and 204B later located the employee. Employee still said he signed and left the documents inside the folder. Supervisor later spoke with Union about the situation of the missing document. 
Union Steward said the employee tore the documents and handed the documents to Steward

**Result** Supe updated to 204B about the situation with the employee. She said the employee admitted to tearing up the documents but was afraid of disciplining issue. The lesson the 204B took away from this situation is to always have the documents signed in front of everone. Also, never trust anything.
